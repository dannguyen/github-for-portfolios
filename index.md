title: Github Pages for Non-Developers: Build Web Portfolios From Scratch 
---

<section class="sec">
This is a very narrowly focused-tutorial about web development aimed at novices who have absolutely no web devleopment experiences, nor have used [Github](https://github.com) or [Git](http://git-scm.com/), or even the command line. 

The end product is a web portfolio, built (mostly) from scratch, that is easy to edit and easy to publish _anywhere_ &ndash; Github merely provides an easy starting point.

##### Topics covered
- How to use Github and Github Pages to publish content
- How to use the Github desktop app
- Some HTML and CSS concepts
- How to edit a text-file

##### Topics not covered
- Basic Git concepts and syntax
- How to use Github to collaborate
- The command-line
- Advanced web development
- The difference between Git and Github

####  Why Github?

Because it's easy and free. And if you don't like Github, you can take the exact code you've produced and put it anywhere else that acts as a web server. The important thing is: if you _do_ want to learn web development, how to use Git, how to use Github, how to program, and so forth, this lesson provides a stepping-stone to those concepts as well as a canvas to practice on. And even if you don't want to learn anything, you can come away with something useful: a customized web homepage that you can maintain yourself.

_To be added: more text, explanation_

<!-- 
## Minimal Github

I think Github's a great service, something that has done an unimaginable amount in spreading information and good concepts.

But this is not a tutorial on how to use Github. If Github, or git, was relevant to your current life, you'd be using it by now, or at least have enough sense to read a proper tutorial.

This is a tutorial on basic Web concepts and creation. Github is merely the host, and we are the parasites. All this talk of pull requests, diffs, colalboration,etc. are nice, but again, if we needed that.

Github is used because of specific features that prevent us from having to do anything more technical than point-and-click. This is not my personal philosophy, of course, but I also think it's foolish to learn something you don't know that you need.
